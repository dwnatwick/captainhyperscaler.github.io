About the AZ-500 and Azure Security Engineer Associate Badge 

Within the Azure cloud infrastructure certifications, there are varying tracks that can be taken depending upon your role or interest.  Security Engineer Associate is one of those tracks.  The Security Engineer Associate certification is obtained through passing of a single exam, AZ-500.  

Over the past eight months, Microsoft has completed a transition within their Cloud certification program from their traditional MCP, MCSA, MCSE certifications to the Role-based programs.  These Role-based exams and certifications align with the various areas of production applications (M365), customer experience (Dynamics 365), and cloud infrastructure (Azure).
