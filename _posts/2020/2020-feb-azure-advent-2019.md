Azure Advent Calendar 2019 - reposting this to remind everyone of the great videos available at https://azureadventcalendar.com/ and the YouTube channel. 

Welcome to Day 13 of the Azure Advent Calendar.  This has been a great experience to be a part of and it is a privilege to be able to spread the Azure Holiday cheer with the rest of the great people sharing their content.  

 For those not familiar with the project, it consists of 75 videos in 25 days with unique content every day.  Every contributor is providing a video and a blog post, and you can follow them all on Twitter with the hashtag #AzureAdventCalendar.   

Visit the Azure Advent Calendar website daily for new content (https://https://azureadventcalendar.com/ and subscribe to the YouTube channel (Azure Advent Calendar YouTube).  Thank you Gregor Suttie (@gregor_suttie) and Richard Hooper (@Pixel_Robots) for creating, coordinating, and administration of this project.

My video is included below within this blog, but definitely continue to check out the additional content.

In this video, I provide a high level overview of Azure Bots and LUIS, along with a demonstration of these services.  Azure has made these services easy to consume, and free to create and test.
